- 👋 Hi, I’m @JCMUoB
- 👀 I’m interested in Mathematical Analysis, Applied Mathematics and Tertiary level Mathematics Education.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... how to drive :(.
- 💞️ I’m not seeking collaborations but if things come my way I'll always consider them (and probably usually go along with things).
- 📫 How to reach me ... email me at J.C.Meyer@bham.ac.uk
